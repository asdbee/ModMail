# ModMail

Welcome to ModMail. ModMail is an open-source ModMail bot that helps Discord Guild Moderators help their community easily and privately!

Information: This bot is written in eris. You'll need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run it. This bot not hosted anywhere, you will have to host it yourself. For starter users you can use things like [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/).

# Getting started
To setup the bot, head over to [Discord's developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), click new application, then bot, and add a bot account. Copy the token and put it into the token slot of the .env file. To run, ensure you have all the components installed;

`npm install eris`
`npm install moment`
`npm install axios`

### Configure the bot in config.js
